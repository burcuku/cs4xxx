## Course Description

Modern software systems are becoming highly concurrent and distributed. However, these systems are difficult to develop correctly due to many sources of nondeterminism in their execution: such as the interleavings of threads, the order of asynchronous interaction between system components, component failures, or data losses due to unreliable communication channels. As a result, concurrent and distributed systems are prone to so-called Heisenbugs which seem to disappear across executions but manifest in subtle orderings of certain events in the system. Detecting these bugs requires specific techniques to exercise nontrivial orderings of component interactions or injection of faults. 


This seminar course aims to explore recent research in the field of testing concurrent and distributed systems. 


### Expected Prior Knowledge:
- Knowledge on software engineering methods, software testing
- Experience on concurrent/distributed programming is appreciated


## Course Contents

The course starts with a series of lectures and continues with discussions of recent research papers.

During the lectures, we will review the execution models, correctness notions, and basic testing methodologies for concurrent and distributed programs. 

During the seminars, we will explore recent research in the field of practical methods for uncovering concurrency and fault-tolerance bugs. We will implement contemporary testing methods for modern distributed systems and blockchains.
